        "This project builds a monthly supply–demand model for Germany's natural gas system, achieving an ensemble R² of **0.761** through structured feature selection and SHAP interpretability.  \n",
        "The model demonstrates measurable improvement over baseline statistical approaches such as the Seasonal Naive model (R² = 0.685) and provides insights into how weather, imports, and prices influence balance dynamics.\n",

        "### Key Results\n",
        "- 76.1% of variance explained in supply–demand balance  \n",
